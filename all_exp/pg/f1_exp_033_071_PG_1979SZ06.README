#
# Reaction 70Ge(p,g)71As with beam energy between 3.0-3.9 MeV was measured. Primary transitions from different initial proton energies in steps of 15-18 keV and are averaged over resonances to the ground and excited states were measured.  
# 
# Gamma decays were measured with a 37cm^3 Ge(Li) detector.
# Cross sections of primary gamma-rays to low-lying discrete states from the Average # Resonance Proton Capture technique were extracted from measured intensities. The # absolute value of PSF is obtained from this cross section via analysis within the # Hauser-Feshbach theory. General description of the determination of absolute PSF # value can be found in G. Szeflinska et al., Nucl. Phys. A323, 253 (1979).

# Contributions to the uncertainties are not discussed in detail.
