# Reaction 68Zn(p,g)60Ga with two beam energy intervals between 2.18-2.69 MeV and 3.13-3.56 MeV was measured at 3MeV # Pelletron University of Lund. Primary transitions # from both different initial proton energy ranges are obtained in 35 steps and are # averaged over resonances to the ground and excited states # were measured.  
# 
# Gamma decays were measured with a pair spectrometer consisting of a Ge(Li) and # an annular 25cm x 30cm NaI(Tl) detector.  
# Cross sections of primary gamma-rays to low-lying discrete states from the Average # Resonance Proton Capture technique were extracted from measured intensities. The # absolute value of PSF is obtained from this cross section via analysis within the # Hauser-Feshbach theory. General description of the determination of absolute PSF # value can be found in G. Szeflinska et al., Nucl. Phys. A323, 253 (1979). Some # details on the parameters are given in the original paper but exact normalization is # difficult to track.
#
# Uncertainties are not discussed.
