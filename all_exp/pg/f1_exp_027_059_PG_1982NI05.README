# Reaction 58Fe(p,g)59Co with beam energy between 2.27-2.93 MeV was measured at  # University of Lund. Primary transitions from different initial proton energies in 20 # keV steps are averaged over resonances to the ground and seven excited states # were measured.  
# 
# Gamma decays were measured with a pair spectrometer consisting of a Ge(Li) and # an annular 25cm x 30cm NaI(Tl) detectors.  
# Cross sections of primary gamma-rays to low-lying discrete states from the Average # Resonance Proton Capture technique were extracted from measured intensities. The # absolute value of PSF is obtained from this cross section via analysis within the # Hauser-Feshbach theory. General description of the determination of absolute PSF # value can be found in G. Szeflinska et al., Nucl. Phys. A323, 253 (1979). Some # details on the parameters are given in the original paper but exact normalization is # difficult to track.
#
# The errors of experimental intensities are estimated to be peak area determination # (1-15 %), multipole mixing and angular distribution effects (10 %) summing effects (5 # %) and relative efficiency uncertainty about (5 %).No error from absolute # normalization of the cross section to PSF as well as from expected Porter-Thomas # fluctuations is added. The estimated uncertainty from width fluctuations does not # exceed 10%.
