#  Element = Pu   Z =  94   A = 239

#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).

#ANALYSIS   Using the special method for putting into consistency
#            the  results  of  various  experiments   the   cross
#            sections  for several  most  important  photonuclear
#            reactions    (gamma,xn),    gamma,sn),    (gamma,n),
#            (gamma,2n,)  and  (gamma,f)  were evaluated for four
#            actinide isotopes 232Th, 238U, 237Np, and 239Pu.
#           Two sources  of  experimental  data were used - cross
#            sections    obtained    using     quasiminornergetic
#            annihilation  photons  at Livermore (USA) and Saclay
#            (France).
#           For renormalization  of  those  experimental data for
#            total  photoabsorption  (gamma,abs)  reaction  cross
#            sections obtained using bremsstrahlung were used.

#           The method  for  putting  the  results   of   various
#            experiments  into  consistency  to  each other - the
#            method for correction of  (gamma,n)  and  (gamma,2n)
#            reaction cross section data caused by the difference
#            in the analysis that separates the total  counts  of
#            neutrons  into (gamma,n) and (gamma,2n) events.  Its
#            idea is that correspondent "false" part of (gamma,n)
#            reaction   cross   section   is   recalculated   and
#            transmitted  back  into  (gamma,2n)  reaction  cross
#            section.
#ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Mean root-square errors.
#COMMENT    The Livermore  data  evaluation really was the simple
#            renormalization to the correspondent  data  obtained
#            using bremsstrahlung, but Saclay data evaluation was
#            complicated recalculation taking  into  account  not
#            correct    Saclay   neutron   multiplicity   sorting
#            procedure.
