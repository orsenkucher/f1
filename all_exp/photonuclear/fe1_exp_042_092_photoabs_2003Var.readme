#  Element = Mo   Z =  42   A =  92

#
#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).

#ANALYSIS   Total photoabsorption   reaction   sig(g,abs)   cross
#            section  data for 19 (for 15 new) nuclei from 12C to
#            208Pb were evaluated using the partial  photonuclear
#            reaction cross section sums sig(g,abs) = sig(g,sn) +
#            sig(g,p) = sig (g,1n) + sig(g,np) + sig(g,2n) +  ...
#            + sig(g,p),  sig(g,sn) = sig(g,xn) - sig(g,2n),  sig

#COMMENT    With the   aim   of   new   information   for   total
#            photoabsorption reaction  sig(g,abs)  = sig (g,1n) +
#            sig(g,np) + sig(g,2n) + ... + sig(g,p) cross section
#            obtaining the  published experimental data for total
#            and partial    photonuclear    (photoneutron     and
#            photoproton) reaction  cross sections were analyzed.
#            Using linear combinations of partial reaction  cross
#            sections, 19   (15   new)  photoabsorption  reaction
#            (g,abs) cross sections  were  evaluated  for  nuclei
#            from 12C to 208Pb.
