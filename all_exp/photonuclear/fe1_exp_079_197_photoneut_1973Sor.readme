#  EXPERIMENTAL PHOTON STRENGTH FUNCTIONS (PSF) FOR GAMMA-ABSORPTION
#
#  EXFOR Subent =  M0650003
#  Element = Au   Z =  79   A = 197
#
#
#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).

#COMMENT    Photoneutron yields for 197Au and 209Bi were measured
#            for  energies  Eg < 28 MeV.  Reaction cross sections
#            were obtained using Penfold-Leiss unfolding  method.
#            Integrated cross sections are equal to 4060 and 4590
#            MeV*mb correspondingly.
