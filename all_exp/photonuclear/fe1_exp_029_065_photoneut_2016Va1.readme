#  EXPERIMENTAL PHOTON STRENGTH FUNCTIONS (PSF) FOR GAMMA-ABSORPTION
#
#  EXFOR Subent =  M0920005
#  Element = Cu   Z =  29   A =  65
#
#
#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).

#ANALYSIS   The joint analysis  of  data  for  total  (g,xn)  and
#            partial (g,n),  (g,2n) and (g,3n) reactions obtained
#            in various experiments  was  carried  out.  The  new
#            approach  to  analysis  of  systematic disagreements
#            between  data  was  proposed  on  the  base  of  new
#            criteria  of  systematic  uncertainties  presence  -
#            specially   proposed    transitional    multiplicity
#            functions
#                        Fi-theor = SIG(g,in)/SIG(g,xn).
#            Using  these functions calculated in  the  frame  of
#            combined photonuclear  reaction  model  new reliable
#            and free from problems of   neutron   multiplicity
#            sorting data  for  photoneutron  partial   reactions
#            cross sections
#                 SIG-eval(g,in) = Fi-theor x SIG-exp(g,xn)
#            were  evaluated  using   experimental  neutron yield
#            reaction cross sections SIG-exp(g,xn).
