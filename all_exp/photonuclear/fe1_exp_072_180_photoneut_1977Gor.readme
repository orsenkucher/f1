#  EXPERIMENTAL PHOTON STRENGTH FUNCTIONS (PSF) FOR GAMMA-ABSORPTION
#
#  EXFOR Subent =  M0007004
#  Element = Hf   Z =  72   A = 180
#
#
#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).
