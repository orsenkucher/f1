#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the

#DETECTOR   (BF3) Paraffin and BF3 tube 4pi detector.
#METHOD     (EXTB,RINGR) Direct photoneutron detection.
#            Ring-ratio neutron multiplicity measurement.
#CORRECTION After the recorded neutron events were corrected for
#            pileup in the detector, the neutron backgrounds
#            (annihilation target removed) were substracted for
#            both the positron and electron measurements.
#           Because the energy spectrum of the annihilation-plus-
#            Bremsstrahlung radiation differs from that of purely
#            Bremsstrahlung photons, a measured correction was
#            applied to the ion-chamber (beam monitor) response to
#            normalize the electron data to the positron data.
#           The normalized electron data then were substracted
#            from the positron data, leaving the neutron counts
#            which result only from the annihilation radiation.
#           The measured sample-blank data, normalized to equal
#            photon flux, were substracted from the target data to
#            give the net target results.
#           After a small correction for the neutron multiplicity
#            in each ring, the data were corrected for the energy-
#            dependent efficiency of the neutron detector using the
#            ring-ratio result for each energy.
#ANALYSIS   The data were converted to photoneutron cross sections
#            by applying the measured ion-chamber response per
#            photon, the known number of target nuclei in the beam
#            and a small correction for the photon attenuation in
#            the sample.
#           Since the (gamma,p) contribution for medium and heavy
#            nuclei can be neglected the total photoneutron
#            absorption cross section, (gamma,abs) = (gamma,n) +
#            (gamma,n+p) + (gamma,2n) can be obtained.
#           Used the ring-ratio technique, whereby the average
#            energy for the photoejected neutrons determined for
#            each data point, has been extended to include triple-
#            photoneutron events as well as single- and double-
#            photoneutron events. These energies serve to determine
#            the neutron detector efficiencies necessary to compute
#            the (gamma,1n), (gamma,2n), and (gamma,3n) cross
#            sections individually.
#ERR-ANALYS (DATA-ERR) Statistical errors only.
#           Systematic uncertainties due to isotope impurities in
#            the targets were estimated to be about 7% for all
#            targets with the exception of 186Os which is about 10%
#           Although the fractional uncertainties involved in the
#            various partial cross sections might become
#            appreciable in those energy regions where those cross
#            sections themselves are small (such as for (gamma,1n),
#            cross sections a few MeV above the (gamma,2n)
#            thresholds) owing to the statistical nature of ring-
#            ratio data, the overall uncertainty in the total
#            photoneutron cross section (gamma,n-i) is not much
#            worsened by the imperfect knowledge of the detector
#            efficiency.
#           Thus, while the absolute cross sections have been
#            determined with an accuracy of about 7%, the relative
#            precision of the cross section measurements between
#            different osmium isotopes is far better (2 - 3%).
#ADD-RES    Information extracted from the data includes
#            parameters of the giant dipole and quadrupole
#            resonances, integrated cross sections and their
#            moments, nuclear symmetry energies, and nuclear
#            deformation parameters and intrinsic quadrupole
#            moments.
#COMMENT    No fewer than eight kinds of evidence point to a sudden
#            change of behavior between 189Os and 190Os, which
#            could be interpreted as a phase transition from a
#            statically deformed prolate nucleus to a gamma-
#            unstable one, in general (but not detailed) agreement
