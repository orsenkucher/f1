#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).

#           The quasimonocromatic photon beam energy resolution

#ANALYSIS   Since the (gamma,p) contribution of medium and heavy
#            nuclei can be neglected one obtains the total
#            photonuclear absorption cross section: (gamma,abs) =

#COMMENT    The evolution of the GDR as observed through the
#            neutron exit channel only, is tentatively interpreted
#            either in terms of isospin splitting or in terms of
