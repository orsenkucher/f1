#  EXPERIMENTAL PHOTON STRENGTH FUNCTIONS (PSF) FOR GAMMA-ABSORPTION

#  EXFOR Subent =  L0111003
#  Element = Ta   Z =  73   A = 181
#
#
#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database. 
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) corresponds to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays: 
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).

#CORRECTION Neutron detector efficiency checked with a Ra-Be
#            (alpha,n) neutron source.
#           Cross section was corrected from the water in the Tb
#            sample (corrections was less than 4 %).
