#
#
#  PSF for gamma-absorption (f1(E)) were extracted from the
#  photoabsorption/photo-neutron cross sections (CSa(E)) at
#  different gamma-ray energies (E) from EXFOR database.
#  It was adopted, that CSa(Eg) c to absorption of
#  electric dipole gamma-rays:
#  f1(E)= CSa(E)/(3*E*(pi*hbar*c)^2).
