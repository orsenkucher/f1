 # Gd-155 2keV data BNL
 # Ig/Eg**5 extracted from H.H Schmidt et al., J.Phys. G: 12 (1986) 411 converted in Ig/Eg**3
 # E2 data given as < Ig, are adopted as Ig/2
 # Normalization of 8E1 transitions with <Eg=5.9 MeV> to < f(E1)> = 8.7 E-08  from DRC <f(E1)> table [INDC(NED)-013]
 # M1 corrected for 0.18 E1 p-waves contribution from empirical estimate
 # Uncertainty of PSF: The experimental statistical error is quoted
 # Porter-Thomas dispersion estimate: 1+dPT=sqrt(2)/v=1.17
 # RN EXP18 = 8.81E-08MeV-3 F = 1.01
