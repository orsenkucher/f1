 # Hf-180 boron data ANL
 # Ig/Eg taken from D.L. Bushnel et al., Phys.Rev. C10 (1974) 2483
 # The Q(JiJf) correction: the simplified Q(JiJf) = 2 has been applied, for Jpi xx disregarded
 # Normalization of 4E1 transitions  (<Eg> = 5.95 MeV)  compared to <f(E1)> =10.01 E-08 from DRC <f(E1)> systematic equation [INDC(NED)-013]
 # p-wave contribution assumed negligible
 # Uncertainty of PSF: The experimental statistical error is quoted
 # Porter-Thomas dispersion estimate: 1+dPT=sqrt(2)/v=1.10
 # RN SYS18 F = 1.08 from systematic equation [INDC(NED)-0772]
